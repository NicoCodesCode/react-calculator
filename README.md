# React Calculator

It's just another simple calculator application built with React that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This is the first React project I make, please feel free to tell me where I can improve.

## Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-calculator.git
cd react-calculator
npm install
```
